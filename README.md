# Frontend Jokes API

This is a simple project that gets jokes from the SV jokes API - By default, it reloads a new joke from the API everytime the page reloads and you can as well get jokes by selecting the category and clicking the button.
Its just a plain html and Javascript project with little to no CSS involved and its not complicated project.
